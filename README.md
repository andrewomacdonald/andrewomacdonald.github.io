A personal webpage utilizing CSS, Bootstrap and HTML with links to all my relevant information.


KNOWN ISSUES:
-Scrolling through the projects container looks bad and doesn't work.

-Scrollbar thumb flickers if moving too fast thanks to something strange going on in my directive I haven't figure out yet.

-Projects Header does not hide from page when container behind it is smaller than font size. Have a good idea how to fix it.
